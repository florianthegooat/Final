WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE JS FILE CAUSE I HAVE NO IDEA


1. Global Variables & Data
Apply to main.js
Statistics variables: Store the numbers for the animated counters (clients, products, years, satisfaction)
Services array: Contains all service information (icon, title, description) used in modals
2. Initialization
Apply to main.js
DOMContentLoaded: Waits for the page to fully load before running any code
initializeStatistics(): Logs the statistics data to console
addEventListeners(): Sets up all click and form event listeners
animateCounters(): Starts the animated counting effect for statistics
addScrollEffects(): Adds fade-in animations when scrolling
setActiveNavigation(): Highlights the current page in the navigation menu
3. Counter Animation
Apply to main.js
Purpose: Creates the animated counting effect (0 â†’ 1250 clients, etc.)
How it works:
Finds elements by ID (clientsCount, productsCount, etc.)
Animates from 0 to target number over 2 seconds
Uses setInterval to increment the number gradually
4. Event Listeners
Apply to main.js
Form submissions: Catches when users submit contact forms
Button clicks: Handles all button interactions (services, contact, etc.)
Input changes: Provides real-time validation and character counting
5. Form Handling
Apply to main.js
Prevents default submission: Stops the browser from submitting the form normally
Validates form data: Checks if all required fields are filled correctly
Shows loading state: Displays "Processing..." while simulating form submission
Shows success/error messages: Provides user feedback
Resets form: Clears all fields after successful submission
Closes modal: Automatically closes the modal after submission
6. Form Validation
Apply to main.js
Required field check: Ensures no required fields are empty
Email validation: Uses regex to check email format
Phone validation: Ensures phone numbers are at least 8 digits
Returns true/false: Indicates if form is valid
7. Button Click Handling
Apply to main.js
Gets button action: Reads the button text or data-action attribute
Switch statement: Routes to appropriate function based on button type
Modal functions: Opens different modals (services, products, contact)
8. Modal System
Apply to main.js
Dynamic modal creation: Creates modals on-the-fly using JavaScript
Bootstrap integration: Uses Bootstrap's modal system for animations
Content injection: Injects HTML content into the modal
Services data: Uses the services array to populate modal content
9. Real-time Input Validation
Apply to main.js
Real-time feedback: Validates as user types
Visual indicators: Adds/removes Bootstrap validation classes
Character counting: Shows remaining characters for textareas
Email validation: Checks email format in real-time
10. Scroll Effects
Apply to main.js
Intersection Observer: Modern way to detect when elements come into view
Fade-in animation: Adds CSS class when elements are visible
Performance optimized: Only triggers when elements enter viewport
11. Navigation Management
Apply to main.js
Active page highlighting: Highlights current page in navigation
Path detection: Determines current page from URL
Class management: Adds/removes 'active' class appropriately
Key Features Summary:
Animated counters for statistics
Form validation with real-time feedback
Modal system for services and contact forms
Scroll animations for better UX
Navigation highlighting for current page
Character counting for text areas
Loading states and success/error messages
Responsive interactions across all pages
The code creates a modern, interactive website with smooth animations, proper form handling, and excellent user experience!
